    <div class="child2"><h1>🔥 Sanji – The Black Leg Chef of the Straw Hat </h1>
    <p>Sanji, the suave and fiery cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, is known not only for his exceptional culinary skills but also for his deadly martial arts—particularly his powerful kicks, which earned him the title “Black Leg.” Raised in the Baratie floating restaurant and trained under the legendary chef Zeff,
         Sanji values food and hunger deeply, refusing to let anyone starve—even an enemy. A true gentleman with a soft spot for ladies, Sanji fights with his legs to protect his hands for cooking. Beneath his flirtatious charm lies a fiercely loyal warrior who dreams of discovering the All Blue—a legendary sea where all the world’s fish meet. Whether it’s in the kitchen or on the battlefield, Sanji always brings the heat.</p></div>

        <h1>  💘 🔥Ladies First, Fists Later! The Wild Ways <span> of Sanji the Simp-Kick Legend"</span></h1>
        <p class="t1">Sanji’s behavior is a whirlwind of cool, chaos, and chivalry. When it comes to women, he transforms into a hopeless romantic—hearts in his eyes, nosebleeds ready, and poetic lines flying left and right. He’ll cook, bow, protect, and even sacrifice himself without hesitation for any lady, friend or foe. But when facing male enemies, Sanji switches gears 
            into a cold, calculated fighter who shows zero mercy. He’s quick-tempered, especially when someone insults his cooking or hurts his crew. Despite his dramatic reactions, over-the-top flirting, and no-nonsense attitude with guys, Sanji is deeply loyal, highly intelligent, and has an unshakable moral code. He may be the Straw Hat crew’s biggest flirt, but when the heat is on—Sanji always kicks in style.</p>

        <h1>  🔥 Sanji’s Train Fight – Enies Lobby Arc</h1>
        <p class="t1">While heading to Enies Lobby to rescue Robin, Sanji boards the Puffing Tom and takes on CP7 agent Wanze, a bizarre fighter who uses ramen noodles as weapons. Offended by the misuse of food, Sanji refuses to use his hands and fights only with powerful kicks. Using his cooking skills mid-battle, he softens Wanze’s noodle armor and defeats him with style—proving both his strength and pride as a chef.
