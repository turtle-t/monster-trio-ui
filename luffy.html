        <h2> The Future King of the Pirates</h2>
        <p>Monkey D. Luffy is the main character of the anime and manga One Piece. He is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and dreams of becoming the King of the Pirates. Luffy is known for his cheerful personality, strong will, and deep loyalty to his friends. He ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, which gave his body rubber-like properties. Throughout his journey, he gathers a strong crew and faces powerful enemies, all while heading toward the mysterious treasure known as the One Piece.

        <h1>Luffy vs Lucci at Egghead Island</h1>
        <p>At Egghead Island, Luffy once again clashes with Rob Lucci, the CP0 assassin who was once his rival at Enies Lobby.
             This time, Lucci has grown even stronger with his Awakened Zoan powers, but Luffy, now a Yonko and in his Gear 5 form, 
             completely outmatches him. Their battle is intense, but Luffy easily dominates, showcasing the vast gap in their power. This fight
              marks how far Luffy has come since their last deadly encounter.

            <h1>The Final Clash: Luffy vs Kaido in Wano</h1>
        <p>The final battle in Wano reaches its peak as Monkey D. Luffy confronts the mighty Yonko, Kaido, atop the Skull Dome in Onigashima. Fueled by the desire to free Wano and avenge its people, Luffy unleashes the full power of his Haki and awakens his Devil Fruit, revealing Gear 5â€”a transformation of overwhelming freedom and creativity. Kaido, in his dragon form, unleashes devastating attacks, but Luffy's determination burns brighter. The skies split, thunder roars, and with one final, thunderous punch, Luffy defeats
             Kaido, bringing hope back to the Land of Wano and marking the fall of a tyrant.</p></div>
