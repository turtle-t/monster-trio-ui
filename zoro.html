            <h1>Roronoa Zoro – The Pirate Hunter</h1>
            <p>Roronoa Zoro is the swordsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the most powerful fighters in the crew. Known for his dream to become the world’s greatest swordsman, Zoro wields a unique three-sword style (Santoryu), using one sword in each hand and one in his mouth. Loyal, disciplined, and fearsome in battle,
                 Zoro has a strong sense of honor and willpower. He was the first member to join Luffy’s crew and has stood by him ever since, facing countless powerful enemies without hesitation. Despite his serious demeanor, Zoro often gets lost even with simple directions, adding a touch of humor to his strong and stoic personality.

            <h1>The Silent Sacrifice – Zoro’s 
                Legendary “Nothing Happened”</h1>
                <p>In the Thriller Bark arc, Bartholomew Kuma arrives to capture Luffy after a brutal battle. With the crew unconscious, Zoro steps up and offers his life in exchange for his captain's. Instead, Kuma transfers all of Luffy’s pain to Zoro.

Zoro takes it all—silently, nearly dying from the agony.

When Sanji finds him bloodied and broken, he asks what happened.

Zoro simply says:

"Nothing happened."

A moment that defines Zoro’s loyalty, strength, and unbreakable will.

        <div class="child2 ndchild"><h1>Zoro vs King – The Battle of the Beasts</h1>
        <p>During the Wano Arc, Roronoa Zoro faces off against King the Wildfire, the right-hand man of Kaido and a member of the fearsome Lunarian race. King, with his ancient Zoan-type Pteranodon powers and incredible durability, proves to be Zoro's toughest opponent yet.

At first, Zoro struggles to land effective hits due to King’s near-invincible Lunarian defense and unpredictable fighting style. But after unlocking the secrets of King’s race and mastering Haoshoku (Conqueror’s) Haki infusion, Zoro takes his swordsmanship to the next level.

In a final explosive clash, Zoro unleashes powerful new techniques, including King of Hell Three Sword Style, and defeats King in a dramatic mid-air battle—proving his worth as the right-hand of the future Pirate King.

This fight marks a major milestone in Zoro’s journey to becoming the world’s greatest swordsman.</p></div>
